			THE HOTTEST PLANET IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IS 450° C.
			Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system and has an average surface temperature of around 450° C. Interestingly,
			Venus is not the closest planet to the Sun – Mercury is closer but because Mercury has no atmosphere to regulate
			temperature it has a very large temperature fluctuation.
			<br>
			<br>
			NOBODY KNOWS HOW MANY STARS ARE IN SPACE.
			The sheer size of space makes it impossible to accurately predict just how many stars we have. Right now, scientists and
			astronomers use the number of stars only within our galaxy, The Milky Way, to estimate. That number is between 200-400
			billion stars and there are estimated to be billions of galaxies so the stars in space really are completely
			uncountable.
			<br>
			<br>
			HALLEYS COMET WON’T ORBIT PAST EARTH AGAIN UNTIL 2061.
			Discovered in 1705 by Edmond Halley, the famous comet was last seen in 1986 and is only seen once every 75 to 76 years.
			<br>
			<br>
			A FULL NASA SPACE SUIT COSTS $12,000,000.
			While the entire suit costs a cool $12m, 70% of that cost is for the backpack and control module.
			<br>
			<br>
			NEUTRON STARS CAN SPIN 600 TIMES PER SECOND.
			Neutron stars are the densest and tiniest stars in the known universe and although they only have a radius of about 10
			km (6 mi), they may have a mass of a few times that of the Sun. They can rotate at up to 60 times per second after they
			are born from a core-collapse supernova star explosion and have been known to spin as fast as 600-712 times per second
			because of their physics.
			<br>
			<br>
			THERE MAY BE A PLANET MADE OUT OF DIAMONDS.
			As space facts go, this is pretty impressive. Research by Yale University scientists suggests that a rocky planet called
			55 Cancri e — which has a radius twice Earth’s, and a mass eight times greater – may have a surface made up of graphite
			and diamond. It’s 40 light years away but visible to the naked eye in the constellation of Cancer.
			<br>
			<br>
			IN 3.75 BILLION YEARS THE MILKY WAY AND ANDROMEDA GALAXIES WILL COLLIDE.
			The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way – where our solar system is – at rate of around 110 kilometres per
			second (68 mi/s) and eventually the two will collide to form a giant elliptical galaxy.
			<br>
			<br>
			THE SUN’S MASS TAKES UP 99.86% OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.
			Made of three quarters hydrogen and helium for most of its remaining mass, the Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in
			our solar system with a mass of around 330,000 times that of Earth.
